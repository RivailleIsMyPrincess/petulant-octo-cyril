===================
I don't really know what I'm doing right now.

This is my code for a project where I use arduino and a robotic arm to play tic tac toe. I became somwhat familiar with libraries in
C++ and I played around with the serial port. Because I got so excited to program libraries I neglected the mechanical aspect
The program compiles but doesn't work the way I wanted it to. The serial port does not read information the way I expected it to.
The program is largely unfinished, so in the future I might avoid using the serial port when editing the code and use sensors instead.
I would also like to work on the mechanical part more. I do not think of this as a failing of time management. In fact, I spent a long time working
on this project. However it was too ambitious for the allotted time, which I have learned from.
